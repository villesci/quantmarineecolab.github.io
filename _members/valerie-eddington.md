Valerie Eddington (she/her/hers) is an acoustic ecologist interested in quantitative approaches to tackle large datasets and create models. She is co-advised by Dr. Easton White and Dr. Laura Kloepper ([Ecological Acoustics and Behavior Lab](https://kloepperlab.wordpress.com/)). She is working create a model that uses acoustic energy from dense bat colonies during emergence to monitor populations and extract fine-scale phenological information. Additionally, she aims to use acoustic methods to monitor the behavior and phenology of other taxa on large scales to provide insight to species response to climate change and disturbances to inform management strategies and answer ecological questions.

Valerie earned her bachelor’s in Biology with a concentration in ecology, evolution, and environmental science from Saint Mary’s College in 2022. During her time at Saint Mary’s, she worked Dr. Laura Kloepper on multiple acoustic research projects spanning several taxa including Northern short-tailed shrews, fox squirrels, and giraffes. 

In her free time, Valerie enjoys baking, hanging with her cat Stanley, bingeing seasons of the Great British Baking Show, and spending time exploring the beautiful New England coast and mountains (the novelty has yet to wear off for this Midwesterner).
