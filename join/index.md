Our [lab
handbook](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/lab-onboarding/blob/main/qmel-onboarding.md)
is a living document and lays out expectations of lab members.

All lab members must: - Be decent human beings (we don’t work with
jerks) - Have an interest in ecological systems **and** using
quantitative tools (e.g., mathematical models, statistics, R) - Want to
change the world

Members of the lab are strongly committed to anti-racist practices, real
diversity and inclusion efforts, and moving science beyond the ivory
tower.

## Commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity

One of my main commitments as a faculty member is promoting and
supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM. Please consider
applying for a position in my lab if you are a first-generation college
student, a student from a low-income background, a member of a racial or
ethnic minority group, if you identify as a woman or as LGBTQ+, and/or
if you have a disability.

## Current opening - Undergraduate Paid Summer internship, Oyster Ecology and Data Science in New Hampshire

### [*March 5th Update - Applications are currently under review. Applicants will learn of their status no later than March 15th.*]{.underline}

Please fill out our Google Form at <https://forms.gle/LBT6ugw9TwDemcVK6>
to apply. Any questions can be directed to
[drew.villeneuve\@unh.edu](mailto:drew.villeneuve@unh.edu){.email}, but
no applications will be accepted at this email address.

The intern will assist graduate students with laboratory experiments to
help understand the impacts of heatwaves on oyster survival at flowing
seawater facilities at the University of New Hampshire’s Coastal Marine
Lab in Portsmouth, NH and Jackson Estuarine Lab in Durham, NH. In
addition, the intern will have the opportunity to assist on field work
monitoring oyster populations in Great Bay, NH and learn quantitative
tools used in our work. The intern will take on more responsibilities as
the summer progresses, completing laboratory experiments without direct
supervision and potentially undertaking their own independent research.
Interns will have opportunities to learn R programming, data science,
and statistical analysis. We also have opportunities to build and test
novel Arduino biosensors to measure oyster activity if the intern has an
interest in microprocessor applications. Start and end dates are
flexible, but generally expected from June to August for a minimum of
ten weeks.

### Responsibilities

-   Performing aquatic husbandry and maintenance of flowing seawater
    systems.
-   Assist QMEL graduate students with ongoing laboratory experiments
    manipulating temperature in seawater mesocosms.
-   Performing data entry and quality control.
-   Assist researchers with field work tracking oyster population
    trends.

### Required Qualifications

-   Excellent organizational skills
-   Able to work independently and creatively.
-   Previous experience with scientific data entry and processing.
-   Intern should be willing to work on boats and in variable weather
    conditions.
-   Demonstrated interests in ecology, zoology, marine science, climate
    change, and/or aquaculture.

### Desired Qualifications (not required, but any are a plus)

-   Knowledge of statistics or R programming.
-   Previous laboratory research experience.
-   Previous experience caring for aquatic organisms.
-   Access to private vehicle and driver’s license.
-   Experience with Arduino microcontroller and programming.

### Benefits

Interns will receive \$5000 in compensation. We can assist students
finding local housing if needed. You will have the opportunity to hone
your ecological lab and field skills, take part in lab meetings, meet
diverse scientist within QMEL and with our research partners, and
develop your own research as part of your summer with QMEL. We are an
inclusive lab group dedicated to promoting diversity, equity, and
inclusion. We highly encourage you to apply to work with us if you are a
first-generation college student, a student from a low-income
background, a member of a racial or ethnic minority group, if you
identify as a woman or as LGBTQ+, and/or if you have a disability.

Please fill out our Google Form at <https://forms.gle/LBT6ugw9TwDemcVK6>
to apply. Any questions can be directed to
[drew.villeneuve\@unh.edu](mailto:drew.villeneuve@unh.edu){.email}, but
no applications will be accepted at this email address.

## Undergraduate students

The lab often has openings for undergraduate students to contribute to
projects or design a project for an undergraduate thesis/research
experience. All students are paid or receive course credits. These
projects are typically co-designed by the student, QMEL graduate
students, and Professor Easton White. The undergraduate researcher role
in the lab is more detailed in the [lab
handbook](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/lab-onboarding/blob/main/qmel-onboarding.md#being-a-successful-undergraduate-researcher).

We take applications at any time, but interns typically start in
January, June, or August. There are UNH student specific opportunities,
but we also have openings for non-UNH students and recent graduates. The
students most likely to be accepted for a position are those with a keen
interest in developing quantitative skills in the context of marine
systems.

After completing this [form](https://forms.gle/16fogrHEX7duePXw5),
please send [Easton.White\@unh.edu](mailto:Easton.White@unh.edu){.email}
a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research
experience, as well as your research interests and goals and how you
think these align with my research program.

## Graduate students

I am currently reviewing applications for two graduate positions to
start in Fall 2024. I will also likely accept 1-2 students in 2025.
Students could work on a variety of projects, including the
socio-ecological dynamics of small-scale fisheries, aquaculture
mathematical modeling, or decision science related to how to optimize
ecological monitoring programs. The applicant would be expected to have
a strong data science or mathematical modeling background. Applicants
that will be the most competitive for a position will have experience
(and willingness to learn more) with R, quantitative skills (e.g.,
mathematical modeling, statistics), and field work. A basic
understanding of Spanish, French, or American Sign Language is a plus
for some of the lab's projects. If you are interested, please fill out
this [brief survey](https://forms.gle/v8SeNbqEw1GL1f1M6) and then send
[Easton.White\@unh.edu](mailto:Easton.White@unh.edu){.email} a CV and
brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience,
as well as your research interests and graduate school goals and how you
think these align with my research program. It is important to emphasize
why you are interested in working in my lab specifically. I am also open
to chatting about the topics above or potential projects related to
other areas of my research program.

Our [lab
handbook](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/lab-onboarding/blob/main/qmel-onboarding.md)
is a living document and lays out expectations of lab members.

I can accept students through [UNH's Biological Sciences MS and PhD
programs.](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences) There are specific
programs in Integrative Biology (IB) and Marine Biology (MB). The
priority deadline for Fall admission is January 15th each year. Although
less common, I can also accept student through the
[Oceanography](https://ceps.unh.edu/earth-sciences/academics) and
