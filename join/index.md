# <i class="fas join"></i>Join the Lab


All lab members must:
- Be decent human beings (we don’t work with jerks) 
- Have an interest in marine systems **and** using quantitative tools (e.g., mathematical models, statistics, R)
- Want to change the world

Members of the lab are strongly committed to anti-racist practices, real diversity and inclusion efforts, and moving science beyond the ivory tower.

## Commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity

One of my main commitments as a faculty member is promoting and supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM. Please consider applying for a position in my lab if you are a first-generation college student, a student from a low-income background, a member of a racial or ethnic minority group, if you identify as a woman or as LGBTQ+, and/or if you have a disability.





## Undergraduate students

The lab often has openings for undergraduate students at UNH to contribute to projects or design a project for an undergraduate thesis/research experience. These can be paid or count as course credits. These projects are typically co-designed by the student, QMEL graduate students, and Professor Easton White. The students most likely to be accepted for a position are those with a keen interest in developing quantitative skills in the context of marine systems. If you are interested, please send <Easton.White@unh.edu> a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience, as well as your research interests and goals and how you think these align with my research program.


## Graduate students

I currently have an opening for a masters student (with potential to extend to PhD) to work on a project using acoustics to estimate dense populations of single species. This student will be co-advised by [Laura Kloepper](https://laurakloepper2.wixsite.com/ecological-acoustics/join-1), another UNH Biological Sciences Professor. This project will utilize stats and population modeling, so I seek students with strong quantitative and coding background. If you are interested, please send <Easton.White@unh.edu> a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience, as well as your research interests and graduate school goals and how you think these align with my research program. 

I will likely accept two graduate students to start Fall 2023. The first student will work in mathematical ecology with applications to spatial ecology and metapopulation biology using oysters as a case study. The second student could work on one of three possible questions: 1) small scale fisheries management, 2) the role of extreme events in marine systems, or 3) the effect of COVID-19 on sustainable seafood. Applicants that will be the most competitive for a position will have experience (and willingness to learn more) with R, quantitative skills (e.g., mathematical modeling, statistics), and field work. A basic understanding of Spanish is a plus for some of the lab's projects. If you are interested, please send <Easton.White@unh.edu> a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience, as well as your research interests and graduate school goals and how you think these align with my research program. I am also open to chatting about potential projects related to other areas of my research program. 

I can accept students through [UNH's Biological Sciences MS and PhD programs.](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences) There are specific programs in Integrative Biology (IB) and Marine Biology (MB). The priority deadline for Fall admission is January 15th each year. Although less common, I can also accept student through the [Oceanography](https://ceps.unh.edu/earth-sciences/academics) and [Integrated Applied Mathematics](https://ceps.unh.edu/integrated-applied-mathematics/academics) programs at UNH. If you are interested in working with me, I strongly recommended that you reach out to me before applying for graduate study. Graduate work is typically funded through a combination of fellowships, research positions, and teaching assistantships. 

Depending on your specific interests, I might not be the best advisor for you at UNH. You may also want to reach out to [Dr. Melissa Aikens (plants, biology education)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/melissa-aikens), [Dr. Elizabeth Fairchild (fish, fisheries)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/elizabeth-fairchild), [Dr. Nathan Furey (fishes, sharks, animal movement)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/nathan-furey), [Dr. Elizabeth Harvey (phytoplankton, harmful algal blooms)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/elizabeth-harvey), [Dr. Brittany Jellison (marine invertebrates, intertidal systems, climate change)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/brittany-jellison), [Dr. Gregg Moore (marine plants, restoration)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/gregg-moore), and others in the [Biology Department](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences/people) or within the [College of Life Science And Agriculture](https://colsa.unh.edu/). 


## Postdoctoral fellows

Conditional on funding, I will likely soon be looking for postdoctoral fellows to work on questions related to fisheries and disturbances, mathematical modeling of disturbances and socio-environmental systems, improving population monitoring and data collection, sustainable seafood, or synthesizing across socio-environmental fisheries. My background is in quantitative ecology with an emphasis on marine systems. However, my interests are broad and I am happy to discuss other project ideas further. I am also open to collaboratively working on proposals to help fund independent postdoctoral fellow positions through several different programs.
